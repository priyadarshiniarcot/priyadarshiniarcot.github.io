								<p>The significance of Big Data quality cannot be overstated, and the project aims to improve it
									through various processes such as cleansing, filtering, integration, data transformation, and noise filtering			
									Consistency is crucial, and to achieve it, we suggest evaluating different types of raw data during the pre-
									handling stage to enhance precision since not all data bits are utilized in later stages. The large volume of data
									may come from diverse sources, including business network exchange systems, consumer records, computer-
									generated data, and real-time data sensors from the Internet of Things. All the information and skills necessary
									for their implementation are stored within the big data network.</p>
